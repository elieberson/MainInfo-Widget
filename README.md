# MainInfo-Widget
Simple and small Rainmeter widget that displays the essentials (time, day, date, and battery) and also has a few other handy tools

## Requirements
- Install Rainmeter
- Laptop (not required but half the widget is for battery monitoring)

## Setup
1. Move this folder with the rest of the skins in Rainmaker. Will probably be under "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins"
2. Open rainmeter context menu. One method of doing this is opening cmd, navigating to the rainmeter program, probably found at "C:\Program Files\Rainmeter" and then calling `Rainmeter.exe !Manage`
3. Inside the menu, Go to "MainInfo-Widget\InfoTop" and select colored or white.
  - Set the coordinates to the top right of the screen
  - Position to "Stay topmost"
  - On hover to "Hide"
  - Make sure "Click through", "Keep in screen", "Save position", and "Snap to edges" are checked.
  * Repeat for "MainInfo-Widget\InfoBottom" except set coordinates to the bottom right of the screen
4. Load the preferred module

## How to use
The idea behind this widget is that the user can hide the taskbar and still have the important information at all times. This will usable increase screen space.

Generally, the widget will always stay at the top of all programs. This include videos and other full screen applications. This may be annoying so there are several ways to deal with this.
1. If there is something directly behind the widget, just roll the mouse over it. The widget is click-throughable and will also temporarly disappear while the mouse is over it.
2. Hold Shift and scroll over the widget. This time, it will not disappear. Right click and the widget will jump to the other side of the screen. Top will go to bottom and bottom will go to top.
3. Hold Shift and scroll over the widget. Left click and the widget will disapear. TO get the widget back, just hold Shift, scroll back to where the widget was last seen and left click again. The widget will reappear.
